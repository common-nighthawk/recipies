This year, we challenged ourselves to create a meatless version that’s just as delicious, showcasing vegetables instead of the traditional beef. When Chef Andrea presented this pie, we knew it was a winner. Lentils, carrots, and mushrooms create the saucy, savory filling, which is topped with creamy mashed potatoes and baked to perfection for a wonderfully warming meal that lives up to its name.
