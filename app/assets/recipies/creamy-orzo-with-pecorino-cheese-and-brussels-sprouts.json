Slowly simmered risotto-style, this pasta is combined with hearty Brussels sprouts, locally sourced shiitake mushrooms, thyme, and onion for a rich, creamy meal that’s warm and cozy when warm and cozy is most needed. Finished with sharp pecorino cheese, this one’s definitely made for eating family-style.","difficulty":"easy","external_id":"7bb3a64513","fat":null,"images":[{"image":{"url":"//dusyefwqqyfwe.cloudfront.net/uploads/culinary/recipe_image/file/9530/Creamy_Orzo_with_Brussels_Sprouts_0284_1.jpg","size":"full","type":"portrait"}},{"image":{"url":"//dusyefwqqyfwe.cloudfront.net/uploads/culinary/recipe_image/file/9531/Creamy_Orzo_with_Brussels_Sprouts_0281_1.jpg","size":"full","type":"card"}},{"image":{"url":"//dusyefwqqyfwe.cloudfront.net/uploads/culinary/recipe_image/file/9531/menu_small_Creamy_Orzo_with_Brussels_Sprouts_0281_1.jpg","size":"medium-rectangle","type":"card"}},{"image":{"url":"//dusyefwqqyfwe.cloudfront.net/uploads/culinary/recipe_image/file/9529/Creamy_Orzo_with_Brussels_Sprouts_0279_1.jpg","size":"full","type":"main"}},{"image":{"url":"//dusyefwqqyfwe.cloudfront.net/uploads/culinary/recipe_image/file/9529/hero_Creamy_Orzo_with_Brussels_Sprouts_0279_1.jpg","size":"hero","type":"main"}},{"image":{"url":"//dusyefwqqyfwe.cloudfront.net/uploads/culinary/recipe_image/file/9529/menu_small_Creamy_Orzo_with_Brussels_Sprouts_0279_1.jpg","size":"medium-rectangle","type":"main"}},{"image":{"url":"//dusyefwqqyfwe.cloudfront.net/uploads/culinary/recipe_image/file/9529/small_square_Creamy_Orzo_with_Brussels_Sprouts_0279_1.jpg","size":"small-square","type":"main"}},{"image":{"url":"//dusyefwqqyfwe.cloudfront.net/uploads/culinary/recipe_image/file/9529/medium_square_Creamy_Orzo_with_Brussels_Sprouts_0279_1.jpg","size":"medium-square","type":"main"}},{"image":{"url":"//dusyefwqqyfwe.cloudfront.net/uploads/culinary/recipe_image/file/9529/recipe_profile_page_Creamy_Orzo_with_Brussels_Sprouts_0279_1.jpg","size":"large-rectangle","type":"main"}},{"image":{"url":"/assets/blank_profile-62376be1ebee267193d25c20f8cd8bc5a6c47743a4a323d32a54ecdf231b7b80.png","size":"large_cropped","type":"main_cropped"}}],"name":"Creamy Orzo with Pecorino Cheese and Brussels Sprouts","novice_time":"","portion_count":2,"prep_time":"35-45","pro_time":"","product_type":{"slug":"subscription","included_in_subscription":true},"protein":null,"public_slug":"creamy-orzo-with-pecorino-cheese-and-brussels-sprouts","pdf_url":"//dusyefwqqyfwe.cloudfront.net/public_uploads/recipe/region_schedule/downloadable_recipe_card/6007/recipe_card20160129-3-pe30rq.pdf","recipe_id":1268,"type":"regular","servings":2,"short_name":"Orzo with Brussels","subtitle":"with Pecorino Cheese and Brussels Sprouts","title":"Creamy Orzo","legal_copy_short":null,"available_for_non_sub":false,"additional_price":"0","cooking_tip":"Be sure to read through the entire recipe before you begin cooking.
