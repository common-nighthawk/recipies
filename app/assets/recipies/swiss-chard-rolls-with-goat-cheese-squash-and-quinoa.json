Large chard leaves are blanched, then wrapped around a filling of quinoa, goat cheese, shallot, and dried cranberries. Topped with hand-crafted marinara sauce from our friends at Nello’s, these rolls get baked until they’re warm and fragrant. Here, we love how all the flavors meld for a dish that’s pretty unforgettable.","difficulty":"medium","external_id":"6dfd06673e","fat":null,"images":[{"image":{"url":"//dusyefwqqyfwe.cloudfront.net/uploads/culinary/recipe_image/file/9316/Swiss_Chard_Rolls_with_Quinoa__Goat_Cheese__and_Cranberries_THUMB.jpg","size":"full","type":"card"}},{"image":{"url":"//dusyefwqqyfwe.cloudfront.net/uploads/culinary/recipe_image/file/9316/menu_small_Swiss_Chard_Rolls_with_Quinoa__Goat_Cheese__and_Cranberries_THUMB.jpg","size":"medium-rectangle","type":"card"}},{"image":{"url":"//dusyefwqqyfwe.cloudfront.net/uploads/culinary/recipe_image/file/9314/Swiss_Chard_Rolls_with_Quinoa__Goat_Cheese__and_Cranberries_MOBILE.jpg","size":"full","type":"portrait"}},{"image":{"url":"//dusyefwqqyfwe.cloudfront.net/uploads/culinary/recipe_image/file/9315/Swiss_Chard_Rolls_with_Quinoa__Goat_Cheese__and_Cranberries_HERO.jpg","size":"full","type":"main"}},{"image":{"url":"//dusyefwqqyfwe.cloudfront.net/uploads/culinary/recipe_image/file/9315/hero_Swiss_Chard_Rolls_with_Quinoa__Goat_Cheese__and_Cranberries_HERO.jpg","size":"hero","type":"main"}},{"image":{"url":"//dusyefwqqyfwe.cloudfront.net/uploads/culinary/recipe_image/file/9315/menu_small_Swiss_Chard_Rolls_with_Quinoa__Goat_Cheese__and_Cranberries_HERO.jpg","size":"medium-rectangle","type":"main"}},{"image":{"url":"//dusyefwqqyfwe.cloudfront.net/uploads/culinary/recipe_image/file/9315/small_square_Swiss_Chard_Rolls_with_Quinoa__Goat_Cheese__and_Cranberries_HERO.jpg","size":"small-square","type":"main"}},{"image":{"url":"//dusyefwqqyfwe.cloudfront.net/uploads/culinary/recipe_image/file/9315/medium_square_Swiss_Chard_Rolls_with_Quinoa__Goat_Cheese__and_Cranberries_HERO.jpg","size":"medium-square","type":"main"}},{"image":{"url":"//dusyefwqqyfwe.cloudfront.net/uploads/culinary/recipe_image/file/9315/recipe_profile_page_Swiss_Chard_Rolls_with_Quinoa__Goat_Cheese__and_Cranberries_HERO.jpg","size":"large-rectangle","type":"main"}},{"image":{"url":"/assets/blank_profile-62376be1ebee267193d25c20f8cd8bc5a6c47743a4a323d32a54ecdf231b7b80.png","size":"large_cropped","type":"main_cropped"}}],"name":"Swiss Chard Rolls with Goat Cheese, Squash, and Quinoa","novice_time":"","portion_count":2,"prep_time":"35-45","pro_time":"","product_type":{"slug":"subscription","included_in_subscription":true},"protein":null,"public_slug":"swiss-chard-rolls-with-goat-cheese-squash-and-quinoa","pdf_url":"//dusyefwqqyfwe.cloudfront.net/public_uploads/recipe/region_schedule/downloadable_recipe_card/5610/recipe_card20151214-3-11qj6fw.pdf","recipe_id":345,"type":"regular","servings":2,"short_name":"Swiss Chard Rolls","subtitle":"with Goat Cheese, Squash, and Quinoa","title":"Swiss Chard Rolls","legal_copy_short":null,"available_for_non_sub":false,"additional_price":"0","cooking_tip":"Be sure to read through the entire recipe before you begin cooking.
