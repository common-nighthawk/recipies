Sweet potatoes are blanched, and then grilled to achieve both tender perfection and smoky char—and who doesn’t love some good-looking grill lines? A creamy sauce made with goat cheese lends tang and richness.

No worries! Skip step 2 and don't blanch the sweet potatoes. Instead arrange them on a baking sheet and roast them in the oven at 450°F for about 10 minutes. Then remove and flip the potatoes. Add scallions to the baking sheet, return to oven, and roast together for about 10 minutes more.\n\nWhen slicing spicy chiles, avoid touching the inside, and immediately wash your knife, cutting board, and hands afterward.
