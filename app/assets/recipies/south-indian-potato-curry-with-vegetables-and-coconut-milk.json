She’s become particularly interested in the curries of South India—mild, fragrant, and simmered in creamy coconut milk. Here, she combines cauliflower, sweet potatoes, and peas, along with warm garam masala and turmeric. Whole coriander seeds and shallots shallow fry in oil for a crisp garnish.

Served over fluffy basmati rice, this is a satisfying vegetarian dish we can’t wait to dive into. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","difficulty":"medium","external_id":"fecee539b6","fat":21,"images":[{"image":{"url":"//dusyefwqqyfwe.cloudfront.net/uploads/culinary/recipe_image/file/43247/large_cropped_Mjf3JIQDQQmC2dvJC6yH_South_Indian_Vegetable_Curry_with_Cauliflower_and_Potatoes___0636___MAIN.jpg","size":"large_cropped","type":"main_cropped"}},{"image":{"url":"//dusyefwqqyfwe.cloudfront.net/uploads/culinary/recipe_image/file/43244/uI0jQKriRQOkTKD7H5l1_South_Indian_Vegetable_Curry_with_Cauliflower_and_Potatoes___0636___HERO.jpg","size":"full","type":"main"}},{"image":{"url":"//dusyefwqqyfwe.cloudfront.net/uploads/culinary/recipe_image/file/43244/hero_uI0jQKriRQOkTKD7H5l1_South_Indian_Vegetable_Curry_with_Cauliflower_and_Potatoes___0636___HERO.jpg","size":"hero","type":"main"}},{"image":{"url":"//dusyefwqqyfwe.cloudfront.net/uploads/culinary/recipe_image/file/43244/menu_small_uI0jQKriRQOkTKD7H5l1_South_Indian_Vegetable_Curry_with_Cauliflower_and_Potatoes___0636___HERO.jpg","size":"medium-rectangle","type":"main"}},{"image":{"url":"//dusyefwqqyfwe.cloudfront.net/uploads/culinary/recipe_image/file/43244/small_square_uI0jQKriRQOkTKD7H5l1_South_Indian_Vegetable_Curry_with_Cauliflower_and_Potatoes___0636___HERO.jpg","size":"small-square","type":"main"}},{"image":{"url":"//dusyefwqqyfwe.cloudfront.net/uploads/culinary/recipe_image/file/43244/medium_square_uI0jQKriRQOkTKD7H5l1_South_Indian_Vegetable_Curry_with_Cauliflower_and_Potatoes___0636___HERO.jpg","size":"medium-square","type":"main"}},{"image":{"url":"//dusyefwqqyfwe.cloudfront.net/uploads/culinary/recipe_image/file/43244/recipe_profile_page_uI0jQKriRQOkTKD7H5l1_South_Indian_Vegetable_Curry_with_Cauliflower_and_Potatoes___0636___HERO.jpg","size":"large-rectangle","type":"main"}},{"image":{"url":"//dusyefwqqyfwe.cloudfront.net/uploads/culinary/recipe_image/file/43246/v4k5oDz1TNi7EGJKO88y_South_Indian_Vegetable_Curry_with_Cauliflower_and_Potatoes___0631___THUMB.jpg","size":"full","type":"card"}},{"image":{"url":"//dusyefwqqyfwe.cloudfront.net/uploads/culinary/recipe_image/file/43246/menu_small_v4k5oDz1TNi7EGJKO88y_South_Indian_Vegetable_Curry_with_Cauliflower_and_Potatoes___0631___THUMB.jpg","size":"medium-rectangle","type":"card"}},{"image":{"url":"//dusyefwqqyfwe.cloudfront.net/uploads/culinary/recipe_image/file/43245/zvpXqmplRCaf6BpeSV7t_South_Indian_Vegetable_Curry_with_Cauliflower_and_Potatoes___0639___MOBILE.jpg","size":"full","type":"portrait"}}],"name":"South Indian Vegetable Curry with Cauliflower and Potatoes","novice_time":null,"portion_count":2,"prep_time":"40-50","pro_time":null,"product_type":{"slug":"subscription","included_in_subscription":true},"protein":13,"public_slug":"south-indian-potato-curry-with-vegetables-and-coconut-milk","pdf_url":"//dusyefwqqyfwe.cloudfront.net/public_uploads/recipe/region_schedule/downloadable_recipe_card/26240/recipe_card20180316-8-7gju1l.pdf","recipe_id":4365,"type":"regular","servings":2,"short_name":"South Indian Vegetable Curry","subtitle":"with Cauliflower and Potatoes","title":"South Indian Vegetable Curry","legal_copy_short":null,"available_for_non_sub":false,"additional_price":"0","cooking_tip":"\u003cp\u003eBe sure to read through the entire recipe before you begin cooking. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you don't have a fine-mesh strainer, any size strainer or colander will work.
